## Overview

This project was built as part of the Adly AI Engineer interview process. The goal was to create a simple, intuitive interface that transforms generic or robotic AI-generated text into content that feels more natural, expressive, and human-like.

The app leverages large language model APIs to rewrite text with improved tone, relatability, and clarity, making it a valuable tool for content creators, marketers, and teams aiming to polish AI outputs for real audiences.

## Features

- ✍️ Input any AI-generated or robotic text
- 🤖 Enhance tone, relatability, and clarity with one click
- 🧠 Real-time transformation via LLM-powered API
- 💾 Stores user input and results using Supabase
- 🖥️ Fully responsive and accessible frontend UI
- 🚀 Deployed and publicly accessible via Netlify

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **API Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Deployment:** Netlify

## How It Works

1. Paste or type in robotic/AI-sounding text.
2. Click **"Humanize"** to process the text through the language model.
3. Instantly receive a more natural, humanized version of your content.
4. Option to copy the result for use in emails, posts, or publications.
